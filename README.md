# Employee_Salary_Prediction-using-ML

This project aims to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience using simple linear regression.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing two columns: Years of Experience and Salary. The dataset contains a total of 30 observations.

Model

The salary prediction model is built using Python, and the model is built using the scikit-learn library. The project is divided into two parts: data preprocessing and 

modeling. In the data preprocessing part, the dataset is preprocessed and transformed into the required format for the modeling part. In the modeling part, the simple 

linear regression algorithm is used to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how simple linear regression can be used to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. The project showcases how 

to preprocess the dataset and transform it into the required format for the modeling part. The results of this analysis can be used by companies to predict the salary 

of new employees based on their years of experience and make data-driven decisions about salary negotiations.
